# Protein-Variant-Impact-Score
This project aims to produce a pipeline for calculating a protein variant impact score for missense variants in human proteins that map to conserved domains. The impact score is based on substitution scores from Position Specific Score Matrices from NCBI's conserved domain database. Substitutions with  negative impact scores are those least tolerated based on conservation and are therefore most likely to disrupt the structure and function of the protein. The ultimate goal is to predict the likelihood of a pathogenic phenotype for a particular variant based on the impact score.
